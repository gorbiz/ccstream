&#13;
Checkin' up on my mailbox - you know that new-fangled thing
Checkin' up on my email - you know that new-fangled thing
Ain't getting no feedback - my bird has flown
&#13;
Tried SMS'ing - but messed up again
and I tried Googling - guess what, in vain
and my home is a page on the Blues
and my home is a page on the Blues
&#13;
Talkin' of bandwidth - sure ain't got none
Talkin' bout throughput - it ain't no fun
and my home...
&#13;
Checkin' up on the U.P.S. - you know that courier thing
I then checked my answerphone - out of tape, damn that thing
&#13;
and my home...</lyrics></song><song><track>2</track><title>Headcuttin </title><writer>Håkan Sjöström</writer><duration>153</duration><lyrics></lyrics></song><song><track>3</track><title>House Of The Rising Sun </title><writer>trad</writer><duration>267</duration><lyrics>
&#13;
If I had listened to what my Mamma said, I'd a-been at home today
Being so young and foolish, poor boy, let a rambler lead me astray
&#13;
Go tell my baby sister never do like I have done
To shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
&#13;
My mother she's a tailor; she sold those new blue jeans
And I’m going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain
&#13;
Going back to New Orleans, my race is almost run
Going back to spend the rest of my days beneath that Rising Sun
&#13;
One foot is on the platform and the other one on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain
To wear that ball and chain</lyrics></song><song><track>4</track><title>Ratman King </title><writer>CC</writer><duration>279</duration><lyrics>
&#13;
It's early in the morning and I'm going to work
Raring to go and up for the task
I've got company wheels, a hi-tech ratmobile
With automatic clutch and tracking gear
software-updatable year-by-year
It's an ultra-secret wide-range plan
It's rough, but readily unleashable on Man
Rodent power is the name of the game
As my claim to fame is that I know how to get them tame
'coz I'm the ratman king
&#13;
Every town and city and metropolis and
Not a single hamlet is to go amiss
I'm a fairy tale myth of the future, of a rat-minded culture
And the underground vulture, creature, freak of nature
'coz I'm the ratman king
&#13;
So clear the frontpage, stay tuned for the news
Each and every journalist will report his or her views
As the ratpack advances and engages
Plundered loot is what they get in wages
These are truly devastating super-animals
From fresh recruits to five-star generals
'coz I'm the ratman king
&#13;
Domination is their creed and there's no way you'll be freed
Of the trash-sifting riders of the underground sky
I'm their leader until I've been laden to rest
And then I'll resurrect
As the ratman king
&#13;
'coz I'm the rat man king&#13;
That's the thing, rat man king; rat man king</lyrics></song><song><track>5</track><title>Bad &amp; Worse </title><writer>CC</writer><duration>151</duration><lyrics>
I’ve been on the sideline, I’ve been biding time
Right on the borderline, yeah, just to make it rhyme
Astride of the crossline and to make things worse
It’s all like a crossfire, it’s like a curse
May I cross the thin line, between bad and worse
&#13;
May I cross the thin line, between bad and worse
I can’t see that thin line, between bad and worse</lyrics></song><song><track>6</track><title>Poverty Game </title><writer>CC</writer><duration>207</duration><lyrics>
&#13;
Calling all politicians
Get in line for a seat in the row
Calling in mediatricians
You’re bound to make a profit from the show
Tell you neighbor &amp; his sister
About the latest favorite game
And tell the missus and her mister
It ain’t the time to be lame
&#13;
Coz we’re dancing to twisting facts
Hung up upon shifting facts
And who’s who interact in the poverty game
&#13;
Let’s rake in a share of the cake
Get in line for a piece of the pie
Be it real or be it fake
You decide who’s to live, who’s to die
Forget about those disasters
Keep on watching that rising curve
It’s just slaves and we’re the masters
Sit tight, you need a lotta nerve
&#13;
Coz we’re dancing…</lyrics></song><song><track>7</track><title>Strange Fruit </title><writer>Abel Meeropol</writer><duration>381</duration><lyrics>
&#13;
Southern trees bear strange fruit
There's blood on the leaves
There's blood at the roots
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
There's strange fruit hanging from the poplar tree
&#13;
The scenic view of the quiet south
Those bulging eyes, the twisted mouth
The scent of magnolia comes as sweet and fresh
Suddenly: the stench of black burning flesh
Now here my friends
Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
A tear for the rain to gather
The roaring wind to suck
For the sun to rise
And those trees to drop
And I hear there's a strange and bitter crop
&#13;

&#13;
Lemme tell you boy, now you’re down that highway 7
You’d better have a ploy ’coz you ain’t just bound for heaven, so
Watch out for the crossroads as midnight rings its toll and
You may be rocking, but your name’s on the roll
&#13;
I gotta let you know that things ain’t the way they seem here
Everything’s a haze, it’s a diff’rent atmosphere
Get out the way, you don’t belong here coz
Watch out for the crossroads as midnight rings its toll
You may be rocking, but your name’s for sure’s on the roll
&#13;
Blues’ve got no rules, so don’t leave it to fools and let them rich rattle their jewels
To the moves in the grooves, let no fuse stop the juice that’s still making news
&#13;
Watch out for the crossroads as midnight rings its toll
you may be rocking, but your name’s on the roll
&#13;
It’s 11:59 and it’s right about time for a cruise down highway 7
Hellhounds revving up, ghosts moving in and you’re bound to lose your soul, so
Watch out for the crossroads as midnight rings its toll
You may be rocking, but your name’s on the roll
&#13;
Watch out for the crossroads as midnight rings its toll
You may be rocking, but your name’s on the roll so
Watch out for the crossroads as midnight rings its toll
You may be rocking, but your name’s on the roll…
And this turnpike is taking its toll</lyrics></song><song><track>9</track><title>Quake Zone Mama </title><writer>CC</writer><duration>214</duration><lyrics>
&#13;
Quake zone mama you’re on the ground
And you know there’s no help to be found
War zone mama you’re on the ground
And you know your salty tears won’t make a sound
You’re on a poster in some rich land, so
Pray God that someone there will lend a hand
So everyone says they’re right on your case
While you &amp; I know that it’s just another phase
In the media ratings race
Coz everyone says they’re right on your case
While you &amp; I know that it’s just another phase
&#13;
Floodgate mama you’re on right the ground
And you know there’s no help to be found
Yeah, refugee mama you’re on right the ground
And you know your salty tears won’t make a sound
You’re on a poster in some rich land, so
Pray God that someone there will lend a hand
Coz everyone says they’re right on your case
While you &amp; I know that it’s just another phase
In the media ratings race
Coz everyone says they’re right on your case&#13;
While you &amp; I know that it’s just another phase
In the media ratings race…
&#13;
There ain’t no cure for the quake zone blues
Ain’t no cure for the war zone blues
Ain’t no cure for the floodgate blues
Ain’t no cure for the refugee blues
Ain’t no cure for the blues of blues

&#13;
I’m just riding on the road to fate
Hopin’ - hopin’ to get there late
I don’t know where it’s gonna be leading to
And I just might be meeting, be meeting you
Riding on the road to fate
Riding on the road to fate
&#13;
My sight is getting real fuzzy now
And I’m ready to express a vow
I barely can see no more
And the fog hides the shore
Coz I’m riding on the road to fate
Riding on the road to fate
Coz I’m riding…</lyrics></song><song><track>11</track><title>Stock’n’Roll </title><writer>CC</writer><duration>269</duration><lyrics>
&#13;
A choppy session’s my stock in trade
It’s an obsession to make the grade
Dividend is my reverend as profits will never end
I’m the only one to thank
On this golden path to the bank
&#13;
I put a lion’s share in my tank
Laughing all the way to the bank
Laughing all the way
&#13;
For who will the bell toll as we play stock’n’roll
&#13;
A bottom line that’s never in the red
Is just mighty fine like you said
Investment is my testament
As profits are always meant
To come into my hand
I’m the wealthiest of the land
&#13;
I put a lion’s share in my hand
Laughing all the way to the bank
Laughing all the way…</lyrics></song><song><track>12</track><title>Spoonful </title><writer>Willie Dixon</writer><duration>618</duration><lyrics>
&#13;
Could have been a spoonful of coffee
Could have been a spoonful of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love is good enough for me
Man lies about that, man cries about that
Man dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful
&#13;
Could have been a spoonful of water
Spread out on the desert sand
Just a little spoon of this forty-five, save you from another man
Man lies about that, man cries about that
Even dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful
&#13;
Could have been a spoonful of diamonds
Could have been a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love to satisfy my soul
&#13;
Everybody's talking about spoonful
Spoonful, spoonful, spoonful
Everybody's fighting about spoonful
&#13;
